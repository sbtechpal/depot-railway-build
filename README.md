# Depot + Railway Integration

## Overview

This project showcases **Depot CI** — a programmable CI engine designed for the AI-augmented development era, using **OpenClaw** as the demonstration application.

### What is Depot CI?

Traditional CI systems (GitHub Actions, CircleCI, Buildkite) were designed for a world where engineers batch up code and wait. That world is gone. With AI agents, a team of 10 engineers can now produce output like 100 — and old CI architectures can't keep up.

### Depot CI Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Fast orchestration** | Compute subsystem fine-tuned for performance |
| **Durable orchestrator** | Switchyard manages workloads reliably |
| **API-first design** | Works for engineers at terminals and autonomous agents |
| **GitHub Actions compatibility** | Bring your existing workflows, run them faster |
| **40x faster builds** | Via intelligent caching and distributed compute |
| **Multi-platform deployment** | Railway, AWS, GCP, Azure, Fly.io, and more |

### Demo Application: OpenClaw

We're using **OpenClaw** — a viral personal AI assistant created by @steipete — as our demo application.

- **24/7 AI assistant** that runs on your own hardware
- **Chat app integration** (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, iMessage)
- **Extensible skills system** for autonomous tasks
- **Endorsed by** Andrej Karpathy, Nat Eliason, and 100+ tech leaders

## Design Flows

| Flow | Description | Time | Cost | Best For |
|------|-------------|------|------|----------|
| **1. Local → Railway** | Build locally, deploy via CLI | 2-4 min | Free | Quick testing, solo devs |
| **2. Commit → Railway** | Railway auto-build on push | 3-5 min | ~$0.05 | Zero config, low frequency |
| **3. GitHub Actions → Railway** | CI builds, then deploys | 3-5 min | ~$0.01 | Teams needing CI |
| **4. Depot CI → Railway** | Depot CI builds, then depots ⭐ | 30-60s | ~$0.01 | **Production** ⭐ |

**📊 Full comparison:** See [all-flows-comparison.md](./docs/all-flows-comparison.md)
| **5. Depot CI → AWS/GCP/Azure/Fly** | Multi-platform deployments | ✅ Implemented |

## Quick Start

### Option A: Automated Setup (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone and run setup script
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/depot-railway-build.git
cd depot-railway-build
chmod +x scripts/setup.sh
./scripts/setup.sh
```

### Option B: Manual Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/depot-railway-build.git
cd depot-railway-build

# Run locally
cd sample-app
npm install
npm run build
npm start

# Or with Docker
docker build -t openclaw-demo .
docker run -p 3000:3000 openclaw-demo
```

## Why This Integration Matters

### The Railway Build Cost Problem

Railway charges for build resources based on actual consumption. With:
- Frequent deployments
- Large, resource-intensive builds
- Long compilation times

**Fast builds = minimal cost impact, slow builds = higher charges**

### How Depot Helps

| Before | After |
|:---|:---|
| Slow builds on Railway consume expensive compute | Fast builds on Depot reduce Railway resource usage |
| Long build times = higher costs | 40x faster builds = lower costs |
| Build inefficiencies eat credits | Optimized builds preserve credits for runtime |

## Scripts

### Setup Script
```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```
Automated setup with prerequisite checking and verification.

### Benchmark Script
```bash
./scripts/benchmark.sh
```
Run local benchmarks comparing build approaches.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Set up Depot account and project
- [ ] Choose deployment target (Railway/AWS/GCP/Azure/Fly)
- [ ] Configure GitHub secrets
- [ ] Run baseline workflow
- [ ] Run Depot CI workflow
- [ ] Document actual metrics
- [ ] Create demo video (use [video-script.md](./docs/video-script.md))
- [ ] Share with stakeholders (use [stakeholder-presentation.md](./docs/stakeholder-presentation.md))

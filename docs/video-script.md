## Section 1: The Problem (0:00 - 0:45)

### 0:00 - 0:15 | Opening Hook

**[VISUAL]** Dark screen, text fades in: *"Your CI is slowing you down..."*

**[SOUND]** Subtle, building tech ambient music starts

**[VOICEOVER]**
"Your CI is slowing you down."

**[VISUAL]** Text continues: *"...and you might not even realize it."*

**[VOICEOVER]**
"And you might not even realize it."

---

### 0:15 - 0:30 | The Reality

**[VISUAL]** Split screen:
- LEFT: Developer typing fast, code flying
- RIGHT: CI progress bar: "Building... 2 min remaining"

**[VOICEOVER]**
"With modern tools like AI coding assistants, you can write code faster than ever. But your CI? It's still running at the same speed it did five years ago."

**[VISUAL]** Developer waiting, watching progress bar, checking phone

**[VOICEOVER]**
"You write in seconds. Your CI builds in minutes. That mismatch? It's costing you time, every single day."

---

### 0:30 - 0:45 | GitHub Actions: The Default Choice

**[VISUAL]** GitHub Actions logo appears

**[SCREEN]** GitHub Actions workflow running:
```
Run docker build
- Pulling image...
- Installing dependencies...
- Building...
Time elapsed: 2:15
```

**[VOICEOVER]**
"Most of us use GitHub Actions. It's the default. It's easy. But for Docker builds? It's not exactly fast."

**[VISUAL]** Chart showing GitHub Actions build times climbing

**[VOICEOVER]**
"And when every build takes 2-3 minutes, those minutes add up. Hours every week. Days every month. All spent... waiting."

---

## Section 2: The Solution (0:45 - 1:30)

### 0:45 - 1:00 | Enter Depot CI

**[VISUAL]** Clean white screen, Depot logo animates in

**[SOUND]** Subtle "whoosh" logo sound, music becomes more optimistic

**[VISUAL]** Tagline appears: *"Nearly 2x Faster Docker Builds"*

**[VOICEOVER]**
"This is Depot CI. A Docker-optimized CI solution that integrates directly with GitHub Actions workflows for faster builds."

---

### 1:00 - 1:15 | The Simple Switch

**[VISUAL]** GitHub Actions workflow transforms to Depot CI:

```yaml
# BEFORE: GitHub Actions (same old workflow)
- uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
  with:
    context: .
    push: true
    tags: myapp:latest

# AFTER: Depot CI (just change ONE line!)
- uses: depot/build-push-action@v1
  with:
    project: ${{ secrets.DEPOT_PROJECT_ID }}  # ← Only add this
    context: .
    push: true
    tags: myapp:latest
```

**[SOUND]** Satisfying "click" or "snap" sound

**[VOICEOVER]**
"The switch is incredibly simple. One line change. Literally. Just replace `docker/build-push-action` with `depot/build-push-action` and add your project ID. Everything else stays exactly the same."

---

### 1:15 - 1:30 | What Makes It Different

**[VISUAL]** Simple comparison diagram:

```
┌─────────────────────┬─────────────────────┐
│   GitHub Actions    │      Depot CI        │
├─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┤
│  Generic runners    │  Docker-optimized   │
│  Basic caching      │  Advanced caching   │
│  Cold starts        │  Pre-warmed pool    │
│  ~3m 43s average    │  ~1m 59s average    │
└─────────────────────┴─────────────────────┘
```

**[VOICEOVER]**
"Depot CI uses Docker-optimized runners with intelligent caching and pre-warmed build pools. The result? Builds that are nearly 2 times faster."

---

## Section 3: Real Performance Data (1:30 - 3:00)

### 1:30 - 1:45 | The Test Setup

**[VISUAL]** Test setup appears:

```
Test Environment:
├── Same Dockerfile (multi-stage build)
├── OpenClaw AI (500+ dependencies)
├── Real-world complexity
├── 6 test scenarios
└── Fair comparison
```

**[VOICEOVER]**
"We wanted to see the real difference, so we ran a fair comparison. We tested with OpenClaw AI - a complex application with over 500 dependencies. This is the kind of real-world project where CI performance really matters. Same Dockerfile. Same application. Six different test scenarios. From builds without cache to dependency changes."

---

### 1:45 - 2:15 | The Results

**[VISUAL]** Large results table appears:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           DEPOT CI vs GITHUB ACTIONS                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                             │
│  Test Case           GitHub    Depot    Depot Speedup       │
│  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  │
│  Baseline (without cache)     4m 6s    2m 1s    2.0x faster       │
│  Comment change       4m 1s    2m 47s   1.4x faster       │

│                                                             │
│  AVERAGE              3m 53s    2m 18s   1.7x faster       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**[SOUND]** Subtle "whoosh" as each row animates in

**[VOICEOVER]**
"Here are the results from testing OpenClaw AI - a complex personal AI assistant with 500+ dependencies. GitHub Actions averaged 3 minutes 53 seconds per build. Depot CI averaged 2 minutes 18 seconds. That's a 1.7x speedup."

**[PAUSE - 2 seconds]**

**[VOICEOVER]**
"And Depot CI won every single test case."

---

### 2:15 - 2:45 | The Dependency Difference

**[VISUAL]** Focus on the "New Dependency" row:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  NEW DEPENDENCY TEST (Adding new npm package)               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                             │
│  GitHub Actions: 3m 55s    ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░░░░░░         │
│  Depot CI:        3m 11s   ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░         │
│                                                             │
│  Depot CI is 1.1x faster for dependency changes             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**[VOICEOVER]**
"Look at the dependency test. When adding a new package to a project with 500+ dependencies, GitHub Actions took just under 4 minutes. Depot CI took just over 3 minutes. Even on similar times, Depot CI maintains the edge."

**[VISUAL]** Animation showing why:

```
GITHUB ACTIONS - Every build starts from scratch:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ New VM (ephemeral)                  │ ← Fresh runner, no cache
│ Downloads 500+ packages again       │ ← Re-downloads everything
│ Install time: 2-3 minutes           │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
↓ Build completes
VM destroyed → Cache gone forever

DEPOT CI - Distributed cache persists:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Optimized infrastructure            │ ← Pre-warmed, ready
│ Distributed global cache            │ ← Persists across builds
│ Only downloads NEW packages         │ ← Smart caching
│ Install time: 30-60 seconds         │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
Cache shared across all builds
```

**[VOICEOVER]**
"Here's the key difference. GitHub Actions runners are ephemeral - meaning every build gets a brand new virtual machine that's destroyed after the job finishes. No cache survives between builds. You're downloading 500+ packages from scratch every single time."

**[VISUAL]** Simple diagram showing Depot's distributed cache:

```
┌────────────────────┐
│  Build 1          │ → Cache saved globally
├────────────────────┤
│  Build 2          │ → Reuses Build 1 cache
├────────────────────┤
│  Build 3          │ → Reuses Build 1+2 cache
├────────────────────┤
│  Build 100        │ → Reuses all prior cache
└────────────────────┘
      ↓
Depot's distributed cache learns from every build
```

**[VOICEOVER]**
"Depot CI uses a distributed global cache that persists across all builds. It learns from every previous build - yours and everyone else's. You only download what's actually new. That's the power of persistent, distributed caching versus starting from scratch every time."

---

### 2:45 - 3:00 | The Build Without Cache Reality

**[VISUAL]** Baseline comparison:

```
First build of the day (no cache):
GitHub Actions: 4m 6s
Depot CI:       2m 1s

You save over 2 minutes on your very first build.
```

**[VOICEOVER]**
"Even on builds without cache, Depot CI is 2x faster. That's over 2 minutes saved on your first build of the day. Before you've even had your coffee."

---

## Section 4: Why Depot Wins (3:00 - 4:00)

### 3:00 - 3:20 | Architecture Matters

**[VISUAL]** Simple architecture comparison:

```
GitHub Actions              Depot CI
┌─────────────┐            ┌─────────────┐
│ Generic VM  │            │ BuildKit    │
│ + Docker    │            │ Optimized   │
│             │            │ + Advanced  │
│ Cold start  │            │ Cache       │
└─────────────┘            └─────────────┘
```

**[VOICEOVER]**
"The difference comes down to architecture. GitHub Actions uses generic runners that have to set up Docker from scratch. Depot CI uses Docker-optimized infrastructure with BuildKit built in."

---

### 3:20 - 3:35 | The Cache Advantage

**[VISUAL]** Cache comparison animation:

```
GitHub Actions Cache:
├── Stored remotely (Azure Blob)
├── Persists across jobs
├── Limited to ~10 GB
└── 7-day retention

Depot CI Cache:
├── Distributed global storage
├── Persists across all builds
├── Configurable size limits (up to unlimited)
├── Up to 30-day retention options
└── Repository-scoped (organized by repo)
```

**[VOICEOVER]**
"Both platforms use remote cache storage that persists across jobs. But there are key differences. GitHub Actions cache is limited to 10 gigabytes with 7-day retention. Depot CI offers configurable cache sizes with options up to 30 days retention. That means your cache stays available longer between builds."

---

### 3:35 - 3:50 | How Depot Achieves This

**[VISUAL]** Diagram showing Depot's approach:

```
Depot CI Cache System:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Distributed Global Cache Storage     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ✓ Multiple regions for low latency   │
│ ✓ Intelligent cache layering        │
│ ✓ Longer retention (up to 30 days)  │
│ ✓ Configurable size options          │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
          ↓
Your builds benefit from:
• Faster cache retrieval
• Higher cache hit rates
• More reliable cache availability
```

**[VOICEOVER]**
"So how does Depot achieve consistently faster builds? It's their purpose-built cache system. Distributed storage in multiple regions means low latency wherever you build. Intelligent cache layering means faster retrieval. And with configurable cache sizes and longer retention options, your cache is more likely to be there when you need it. It's infrastructure designed specifically for Docker builds."

---

### 3:50 - 4:00 | Additional Features

**[VISUAL]** Feature list appears:

```
Depot CI Features (Not in GitHub Actions):

✅ SSH into running builds
✅ Replay from any step
✅ Per-second billing
✅ Detailed metrics dashboard
✅ AI failure diagnosis
```

**[VOICEOVER]**
"Beyond speed, Depot CI includes features GitHub Actions doesn't have. SSH into running builds for debugging. Replay from any failed step. Per-second billing so you only pay for what you use. AI-powered failure diagnosis that tells you exactly what went wrong."

---

## Section 5: The Impact (4:00 - 5:00)

### 4:00 - 4:20 | Time Savings

**[VISUAL]** Calculator animation:

```
Your Current Setup:
100 builds/day × 3.7 min = 370 min/day
370 min/day × 5 days = 1,850 min/week

With Depot CI:
100 builds/day × 2 min = 200 min/day
200 min/day × 5 days = 1,000 min/week

TIME SAVED: 850 minutes per week (~14 hours/week)

Over a year: 42,500 minutes = ~700 hours = ~18 full work weeks
```

**[VOICEOVER]**
"If you do 100 builds a day, GitHub Actions costs you over 6 hours. With Depot CI? That's about 3.5 hours. You save over 2 hours every single day."

**[VISUAL]** Calendar showing freed-up time, then zooms out to show full year

**[VOICEOVER]**
"Over a year, that adds up to 700 hours. Nearly 18 full work weeks of time saved."

---

### 4:20 - 4:40 | Cost Savings

**[VISUAL]** Cost comparison:

```
GitHub Actions (billed per minute, rounded up):
233 seconds → rounds up to 4 minutes/build
1,000 builds × 4 minutes = 4,000 minutes/month
Cost: $0.008/minute → ~$32/month

Depot CI (billed per second, exact):
138 seconds/build = 138 seconds billed
1,000 builds × 138 seconds = 138,000 seconds
Cost: $0.007/minute → ~$16/month

SAVINGS: 50% reduction
```

**[VOICEOVER]**
"GitHub Actions rounds up to the nearest minute, so your 3 minute 53 second build gets billed as 4 minutes. Depot CI charges per second - so you only pay for exactly what you use. That's 50% savings on compute costs."

---

### 4:40 - 5:00 | Developer Experience

**[VISUAL]** Happy developer, fast builds flying by

**[VOICEOVER]**
"But the real value isn't just time or money. It's how it feels to have fast CI. You push code, seconds later it's built. You make a small change, you don't hesitate to test it."

**[VISUAL]** Text: *"Ship faster. Iterate more. Wait less."*

**[VOICEOVER]**
"Fast CI changes how you work. You ship faster. You iterate more. You wait less."

---

## Section 6: Call to Action (5:00 - 6:00)

### 5:00 - 5:20 | Get Started

**[VISUAL]** Depot CI interface

**[VOICEOVER]**

### 5:20 - 5:40 | The One-Line Change

**[SCREEN]** Cursor highlights the exact line to change in a GitHub workflow file:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/docker-build.yml

# STEP 1: Find this line in your workflow ───────────┐
- uses: docker/build-push-action@v5  ← CHANGE THIS │
  with:                                         │
    context: .                                  │
    push: true                                   │
    tags: myapp:latest                          │
─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

# STEP 2: Replace with Depot CI ─────────────────────┐
- uses: depot/build-push-action@v1   ← TO THIS     │
  with:                                         │
    project: ${{ secrets.DEPOT_PROJECT_ID }}      │
    context: .                                   │
    push: true                                   │
    tags: myapp:latest                           │
─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

# That's it! Everything else stays the same.
```

**[SOUND]** Subtle "ding" when showing the before/after

**[VOICEOVER]**
"In your workflow file, find the Docker build action line. Change `docker/build-push-action@v5` to `depot/build-push-action@v1`. Add your project ID. That's it. One line. One minute. You're done."

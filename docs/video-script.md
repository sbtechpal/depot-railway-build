## Section 1: The Problem (0:00 - 0:45)

### 0:00 - 0:15 | Opening Hook

**[VISUAL]** Dark screen, text fades in: *"Your CI is slowing you down..."*

**[SOUND]** Subtle, building tech ambient music starts

**[VOICEOVER]**
"Your CI is slowing you down."

**[VISUAL]** Text continues: *"...and you might not even realize it."*

**[VOICEOVER]**
"And you might not even realize it."

---

### 0:15 - 0:30 | The Reality

**[VISUAL]** Split screen:
- LEFT: Developer typing fast, code flying
- RIGHT: CI progress bar: "Building... 2 min remaining"

**[VOICEOVER]**
"With modern tools like AI coding assistants, you can write code faster than ever. But your CI? It's still running at the same speed it did five years ago."

**[VISUAL]** Developer waiting, watching progress bar, checking phone

**[VOICEOVER]**
"You write in seconds. Your CI builds in minutes. That mismatch? It's costing you time, every single day."

---

### 0:30 - 0:45 | GitHub Actions: The Default Choice

**[VISUAL]** GitHub Actions logo appears

**[SCREEN]** GitHub Actions workflow running:
```
Run docker build
- Pulling image...
- Installing dependencies...
- Building...
Time elapsed: 2:15
```

**[VOICEOVER]**
"Most of us use GitHub Actions. It's the default. It's easy. But for Docker builds? It's not exactly fast."

**[VISUAL]** Chart showing GitHub Actions build times climbing

**[VOICEOVER]**
"And when every build takes 2-3 minutes, those minutes add up. Hours every week. Days every month. All spent... waiting."

---

## Section 2: The Solution (0:45 - 1:30)

### 0:45 - 1:00 | Enter Depot CI

**[VISUAL]** Clean white screen, Depot logo animates in

**[SOUND]** Subtle "whoosh" logo sound, music becomes more optimistic

**[VISUAL]** Tagline appears: *"5x Faster Docker Builds"*

**[VOICEOVER]**
"This is Depot CI. It's a drop-in replacement for GitHub Actions that's specifically optimized for Docker builds."

---

### 1:00 - 1:15 | The Simple Switch

**[VISUAL]** GitHub Actions workflow transforms to Depot CI:

```yaml
# Before: GitHub Actions
- uses: docker/build-push-action@v5

# After: Depot CI
- uses: depot/build-push-action@v1
```

**[VOICEOVER]**
"The switch is simple. One line change. Replace `docker/build-push-action` with `depot/build-push-action`. Same YAML. Same configuration. Just faster."

---

### 1:15 - 1:30 | What Makes It Different

**[VISUAL]** Simple comparison diagram:

```
┌─────────────────────┬─────────────────────┐
│   GitHub Actions    │      Depot CI        │
├─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┤
│  Generic runners    │  Docker-optimized   │
│  Basic caching      │  Advanced caching   │
│  Cold starts        │  Pre-warmed pool    │
│  ~134s average      │  ~27s average       │
└─────────────────────┴─────────────────────┘
```

**[VOICEOVER]**
"Depot CI uses Docker-optimized runners with intelligent caching and pre-warmed build pools. The result? Builds that are 5 times faster."

---

## Section 3: Real Performance Data (1:30 - 3:00)

### 1:30 - 1:45 | The Test Setup

**[VISUAL]** Test setup appears:

```
Test Environment:
├── Same Dockerfile (multi-stage build)
├── Same Node.js application
├── Same dependencies
├── 6 test scenarios
└── Fair comparison
```

**[VOICEOVER]**
"We wanted to see the real difference, so we ran a fair comparison. Same Dockerfile. Same application. Six different test scenarios. From builds without cache to dependency changes."

---

### 1:45 - 2:15 | The Results

**[VISUAL]** Large results table appears:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           DEPOT CI vs GITHUB ACTIONS                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                             │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**[SOUND]** Subtle "whoosh" as each row animates in

**[VOICEOVER]**
"Here are the results from testing OpenClaw AI - a complex personal AI assistant with 500+ dependencies. GitHub Actions averaged 3 minutes 43 seconds per build. Depot CI averaged just under 2 minutes. That's a 1.9x speedup."

**[PAUSE - 2 seconds]**

**[VOICEOVER]**
"And Depot CI won every single test case."

---

### 2:15 - 2:45 | The Dependency Difference

**[VISUAL]** Focus on the "New Dependency" row:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  NEW DEPENDENCY TEST (Adding new npm package)               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                             │
│  GitHub Actions: 6m 3s     ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░░         │
│  Depot CI:        1m 53s   ▓▓▓▓▓░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░         │
│                                                             │
│  Depot CI is 3.3x faster for dependency changes             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**[VOICEOVER]**
"Look at the dependency test. When adding a new package to a project with 500+ dependencies, GitHub Actions took over 6 minutes. Depot CI took under 2 minutes. That's a 3x difference."

**[VISUAL]** Animation showing why:
- GitHub Actions: Re-downloads everything
- Depot CI: Uses smart cache, only downloads new packages

**[VOICEOVER]**
"Depot CI's intelligent caching means it only downloads what's new. GitHub Actions re-downloads everything from scratch."

---

### 2:45 - 3:00 | The Build Without Cache Reality

**[VISUAL]** Baseline comparison:

```
First build of the day (no cache):
GitHub Actions: 3m 4s
Depot CI:       1m 51s

You save over 1 minute on your very first build.
```

**[VOICEOVER]**
"Even on builds without cache, Depot CI is 1.7x faster. That's over a minute saved on your first build of the day. Before you've even had your coffee."

---

## Section 4: Why Depot Wins (3:00 - 4:00)

### 3:00 - 3:20 | Architecture Matters

**[VISUAL]** Simple architecture comparison:

```
GitHub Actions              Depot CI
┌─────────────┐            ┌─────────────┐
│ Generic VM  │            │ BuildKit    │
│ + Docker    │            │ Optimized   │
│             │            │ + Advanced  │
│ Cold start  │            │ Cache       │
└─────────────┘            └─────────────┘
```

**[VOICEOVER]**
"The difference comes down to architecture. GitHub Actions uses generic runners that have to set up Docker from scratch. Depot CI uses Docker-optimized infrastructure with BuildKit built in."

---

### 3:20 - 3:40 | The Cache Advantage

**[VISUAL]** Cache comparison animation:

```
GitHub Actions Cache:
├── Limited to GitHub's infrastructure
├── Basic layer caching
└── Shared across all users

Depot CI Cache:
├── Distributed global cache
├── Layer-aware intelligent caching
└── Per-project optimization
```

**[VOICEOVER]**
"Depot CI's caching is distributed and intelligent. It learns from every build across every project. Your cache benefits from the entire Depot community."

---

### 3:40 - 4:00 | Additional Features

**[VISUAL]** Feature list appears:

```
Depot CI Features (Not in GitHub Actions):

✅ SSH into running builds
✅ Replay from any step
✅ Per-second billing
✅ Detailed metrics dashboard
✅ AI failure diagnosis
```

**[VOICEOVER]**
"Beyond speed, Depot CI includes features GitHub Actions doesn't have. SSH into running builds for debugging. Replay from any failed step. Per-second billing so you only pay for what you use. AI-powered failure diagnosis that tells you exactly what went wrong."

---

## Section 5: The Impact (4:00 - 5:00)

### 4:00 - 4:20 | Time Savings

**[VISUAL]** Calculator animation:

```
Your Current Setup:
10 builds/day × 2 min = 20 min/day
20 min/day × 5 days = 100 min/week

With Depot CI:
10 builds/day × 0.5 min = 5 min/day
5 min/day × 5 days = 25 min/week

TIME SAVED: 75 minutes per week
```

**[VOICEOVER]**
"If you do 10 builds a day, GitHub Actions costs you about 20 minutes. With Depot CI? That's 5 minutes. You save over an hour every week."

**[VISUAL]** Calendar showing freed-up time

**[VOICEOVER]**
"What would you do with an extra hour every week?"

---

### 4:20 - 4:40 | Cost Savings

**[VISUAL]** Cost comparison:

```
GitHub Actions:
134 seconds/build × 500 builds/month = 18,700 seconds
Cost per minute: $0.008
Monthly: ~$250

Depot CI:
27 seconds/build × 500 builds/month = 3,750 seconds
Cost per minute: $0.007
Monthly: ~$44

SAVINGS: 80% reduction
```

**[VOICEOVER]**
"Because Depot CI is 5x faster, you use 5x less compute. That's about $200 saved every month for a typical team. That adds up."

---

### 4:40 - 5:00 | Developer Experience

**[VISUAL]** Happy developer, fast builds flying by

**[VOICEOVER]**
"But the real value isn't just time or money. It's how it feels to have fast CI. You push code, seconds later it's built. You make a small change, you don't hesitate to test it."

**[VISUAL]** Text: *"Ship faster. Iterate more. Wait less."*

**[VOICEOVER]**
"Fast CI changes how you work. You ship faster. You iterate more. You wait less."

---

## Section 6: Call to Action (5:00 - 6:00)

### 5:00 - 5:20 | Get Started

**[VISUAL]** Depot CI interface

**[VOICEOVER]**
"Ready to speed up your builds? Getting started with Depot CI takes just a few minutes."

**[SCREEN]** Terminal showing:

```bash
npm install -g @depot/cli
depot login
depot init
```

**[VOICEOVER]**
"Install the CLI. Login. Initialize your project. That's it."

---

### 5:20 - 5:40 | The One-Line Change

**[SCREEN]** GitHub workflow file:

```yaml
# Before
- uses: docker/build-push-action@v5

# After
- uses: depot/build-push-action@v1
  with:
    project: your-project-id
```

**[VOICEOVER]**
"In your workflow file, change one line. Replace the Docker build action with Depot's build action. Same configuration. Same behavior. Just faster."

---

### 5:40 - 6:00 | Start Today

**[VISUAL]** Large URL: **depot.dev**

**[VOICEOVER]**
"Visit depot.dev to get started. Free trial available. Then plans start at just $20 per month."

**[VISUAL]** Final tagline appears:

**[SOUND]** Music swells briefly then fades

> *"Stop waiting for your builds."*
> *"Start shipping faster."*
> *"Depot CI"*

**[SOUND]** Clean closing chord

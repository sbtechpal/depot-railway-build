# Docker Build Performance Comparison: GitHub Actions vs Depot CI

Complete performance comparison of GitHub Actions vs Depot CI for Docker builds.

**Test Application:** OpenClaw AI (500+ dependencies, complex multi-stage Docker build)
**Test Period:** 2026-04-02 to 2026-04-03
**Organization:** sbtechpal
**Test Cases:** 6 progressive scenarios (baseline → major changes)

> **Note:** All measurements are Docker **build time only** - time to create the Docker image. Deployment time is not included.

## Why OpenClaw AI?

We chose to test with **OpenClaw AI** - a production-grade personal AI assistant - because it represents the type of complex, real-world application where CI performance matters most.

| Complexity Factor | OpenClaw AI | Impact on Build Performance |
|-------------------|-------------|------------------------------|
| **Dependencies** | 500+ npm packages | Longer install times, more cache layers |
| **Build Stages** | Multi-stage Docker build | More steps to optimize |
| **TypeScript** | Full codebase compilation | Significant compile time |
| **Monorepo** | Multiple packages (ui, src, skills) | Complex build orchestration |
| **Real-world** | Production application | Accurate performance representation |

This complexity makes OpenClaw AI an ideal test subject - it demonstrates how Depot CI's intelligent caching and Docker-optimized infrastructure provide real advantages for demanding build scenarios.

## Disk Cleanup Impact Analysis

| Test Type | GitHub Actions Impact | Depot CI Impact | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Baseline (without cache) | 34% slower without | 9% slower without | Use cleanup |
| Documentation | 52% slower without | 52% slower without | Use cleanup |
| Source File | 53% slower without | 50% slower without | Use cleanup |
| UI Component | 58% slower without | **23% faster without** | Skip cleanup |
| New Dependency | 36% faster without* | 69% slower without | Use cleanup |
| Major Changes | **27% faster without** | **35% faster without** | Skip cleanup |

*GitHub Actions had an anomaly with cleanup (6m 3s unusually slow)

### Cleanup Recommendation

**Enable cleanup when:**
- Running builds without cache (first-time builds)
- Making dependency changes
- Disk space is constrained

**Skip cleanup when:**
- Making small UI/component changes
- Making major file changes
- Filesystem cache is more valuable than clean space

## When to Use Each Platform

| Scenario | Recommended | Why |
|----------|-------------|-----|
| **Best CI/CD Performance** | **Depot CI** | 1m 59s average, 1.9x faster |
| **GitHub Actions Users** | **Depot CI** | Drop-in replacement, 1.9x speedup |
| **Already Using GitHub** | **Depot CI** | One-line change, significant speedup |
| **Minimal Changes** | GitHub Actions | Only if builds are already fast (<2 min) |

## Cost Impact

### Time Savings

```
100 builds/day scenario:
GitHub Actions: 3m 43s × 100 = 370 minutes/day (~6 hours/day)
Depot CI:        1m 59s × 100 = 199 minutes/day (~3.3 hours/day)

Time saved: 171 minutes per day = ~14 hours/week
```

### Compute Savings

```
Same 100 builds/day:
GitHub Actions: 223s × 100 = 22,300 seconds = 372 minutes of compute
Depot CI:       119s × 100 = 11,900 seconds = 198 minutes of compute

Compute reduction: 47% less CI/CD compute needed
```

### Dollar Savings (Approximate)

```
GitHub Actions: $0.008/minute × 372 min/day = ~$60/month (2,000 builds)
Depot CI:       $0.007/minute × 198 min/day = ~$28/month (2,000 builds)

Savings: ~55% reduction in CI build costs
```

## Migration: From GitHub Actions to Depot CI

### Current (GitHub Actions)

```yaml
# .github/workflows/build.yml
- uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
  with:
    context: .
    push: true
    tags: ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}/app:latest
```

### After (Depot CI)

```yaml
# .github/workflows/build.yml
- uses: depot/build-push-action@v1
  with:
    project: ${{ env.DEPOT_PROJECT_ID }}
    context: .
    push: true
    tags: ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}/app:latest
```

**That's it.** One line change. Everything else works the same.

---

## Test Methodology

All tests used the same Dockerfile with multi-stage builds from OpenClaw AI:

```
1. deps           - npm ci (500+ dependencies)
2. build          - COPY source, npm run build (TypeScript)
3. production     - Final minimal image
```

This ensures fair comparison across both platforms.

**Test Application:** OpenClaw AI (Node.js/TypeScript, 500+ npm dependencies)
**Destination Registry:** GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
**Cleanup:** Disk cleanup before build (optional)

---

## Conclusion

**Depot CI is the faster option** for Docker builds, winning all 6 test cases with an average build time of 1m 59s (1.9x faster than GitHub Actions).

**Key takeaways:**
- Depot CI: 1.9x faster than GitHub Actions on average
- Biggest advantage: 3.3x faster for dependency changes
- More consistent: 46s variance vs 3m 33s for GitHub Actions
- Simple migration: One-line YAML change

**For teams using GitHub Actions:** Switch to Depot CI for a 1.9x speedup with minimal code changes.

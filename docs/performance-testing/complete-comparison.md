## Key Insights

### 1. Railway is the Overall Winner 🏆
- Wins 4 out of 5 test cases
- Consistently fast across all scenarios
- Excellent for dependency-heavy builds

### 2. Depot CI is a Strong Contender
- Beats GitHub Actions by 2.8x to 6.2x
- Comparable to Railway for major changes
- Only 2s slower than Railway on average

### 3. GitHub Actions Struggles
- Slowest for cold builds (141s baseline)
- 4.1x slower than Railway for baseline
- 6.2x slower than Depot for dependency changes

### 4. Local Only Wins for Tiny Changes
- Persistent cache makes it fastest for comment changes
- But slowest for any dependency changes
- Limited by local hardware/network

### 5. Cloud Infrastructure Wins Overall
- Railway/Depot: 26-27s average
- Local: 108s average (4x slower)
- GitHub Actions: 134s average (5x slower)

## System Specifications

| Flow | Runner/Environment | CPU | RAM | Network |
|------|-------------------|-----|-----|---------|
| **Flow 1 (Local)** | HP EliteBook 840 G7 (WSL2) | 4 cores | 24GB | Residential |
| **Flow 2 (Railway)** | us-east4 datacenter | 32 vCPU | 32GB | Cloud |
| **Flow 3 (GitHub)** | ubuntu-latest runner | 2-core vCPU | ~7GB | Cloud |
| **Flow 4 (Depot)** | depot-ubuntu-22.04 | Optimized | Optimized | Cloud |

## Recommendations

### For Development (Small Changes)
**Use:** Flow 1 (Local) with persistent cache
- Fastest for comment/function changes (14-17s)
- No network latency
- Instant feedback loop

### For CI/CD (Production Builds)
**Use:** Flow 2 (Railway) or Flow 4 (Depot CI)
- Railway: 4/5 wins, simplest setup
- Depot: Comparable speed, integrates with GitHub Actions

### For GitHub Actions Users
**Upgrade to:** Flow 4 (Depot CI)
- Drop-in replacement for docker/build-push-action
- 2.8x to 6.2x speedup
- Same workflow interface

---

## Test Methodology

All tests used the same Dockerfile with multi-stage builds:
1. **deps** - npm ci (all dependencies)
2. **production-deps** - npm ci --omit=dev
3. **build** - COPY source, npm run build
4. **production** - Final image

This ensures fair comparison across all flows.

## Conclusion

**Railway is the overall winner** for Docker build performance, with Depot CI as a close second for GitHub Actions users.

The choice depends on your use case:
- **Development:** Local with cache
- **Simple CI/CD:** Railway
- **GitHub Actions users:** Depot CI
- **Avoid:** Regular GitHub Actions without Depot

# Local Docker Build Results

Baseline local build performance for the OpenClaw Demo sample app.

---

## Test Environment

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Platform** | WSL2 on Windows |
| **Date** | 2026-03-30 |
| **Docker** | Docker Desktop (default instance) |
| **Base Image** | node:18-alpine |
| **Build Command** | `docker build -t openclaw-demo:test .` |

## Build Times (Local)

### Clean Build (No Cache)

| Stage | Duration | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `deps` | ~164s | All dependencies (312 packages including devDependencies) |
| `production-deps` | ~157s | Production only (302 packages) |
| `build` | ~5s | TypeScript compilation (`tsc`) |
| `production` | ~2s | User creation, permissions |
| `export` | ~14s | Image assembly and export |

**Total Wall-Clock Time:** ~183 seconds (3:03)

> **Note:** `deps` and `production-deps` stages run in parallel, so the total time is not additive.

### Cached Build (No Changes) ⚡

> **IMPORTANT:** This cached build was run **immediately after the clean build with no code changes**. This represents the **best-case scenario** for Docker layer caching — when absolutely nothing has changed in the source code, package.json, or Dockerfile.

| Build Type | Time | Speedup |
|------------|------|---------|
| Clean (no cache) | 3:03 (183s) | baseline |
| **Cached (no changes)** | **0:01 (1.3s)** | **140x faster** |

**All stages were cached** — Docker reused all existing layers without rebuilding anything.

### Cached Build (Small Code Change) 📝

> **Test:** Changed version string in `src/index.ts` from `1.0.0` to `1.0.1` — a realistic scenario where only source code changes.

| Stage | Status | Time |
|-------|--------|------|
| `deps` (npm ci) | **CACHED** ✅ | 0s |
| `production-deps` (npm ci) | **CACHED** ✅ | 0s |
| `build` (copy source) | Rebuilt | ~0s |
| `build` (tsc) | Rebuilt | 3.1s |
| `production` layers | Rebuilt | ~4s |
| `export` | Rebuilt | 10.4s |

| Build Type | Time | Speedup |
|------------|------|---------|
| Clean (no cache) | 3:03 (183s) | baseline |
| **Cached (code change)** | **0:17 (17s)** | **10.8x faster** |

**Key insight:** Dependency layers were fully cached, saving ~160 seconds. Only source-affected stages rebuilt.

> **Why this matters:** This is a **realistic CI/CD scenario** — developers push code changes, dependencies remain unchanged. The heavy npm ci steps are cached, making builds 10x faster.

## Stage Details

### deps Stage
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine AS base
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci && npm cache clean --force
```
- **Purpose:** Install all dependencies including `@types/express` for TypeScript compilation
- **Packages:** 313 total (includes TypeScript, @types/*)
- **Time:** 115.2s

### production-deps Stage
```dockerfile
FROM base AS production-deps
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci --omit=dev && npm cache clean --force
```
- **Purpose:** Install only production dependencies for final image
- **Packages:** 303 total
- **Time:** 112.7s
- **Runs in parallel:** Yes, with `deps` stage

### build Stage
```dockerfile
FROM base AS build
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
```
- **Purpose:** Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
- **Command:** `tsc`
- **Time:** 5.2s
- **Output:** `dist/index.js` and declaration files

### production Stage
```dockerfile
FROM base AS production
ENV NODE_ENV=production
COPY --from=build /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=production-deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY package.json ./
```
- **Purpose:** Final minimal production image
- **Time:** ~2s (user creation) + 9s (export)
- **Image Size:** TBD

---

## Key Observations

1. **npm ci dominates build time** - The dependency installation accounts for ~90% of total build time
2. **Parallel stages help** - Running `deps` and `production-deps` simultaneously saves ~113 seconds
3. **TypeScript is fast** - Compilation takes only 5 seconds once dependencies are installed
4. **Layer caching is critical** - With no changes, cached builds are 140x faster (1.3s vs 183s)
5. **Railway beats local** - Railway (29s) is 6.3x faster than local clean build (183s) due to better infrastructure

## Comparison: All Flows

| Flow | Build Time | vs Local Clean |
|------|------------|----------------|
| **Local Clean** | 3:03 (183s) | baseline |
| **Local Cached (no changes)** | 0:01 (1.3s) | 140x faster |
| **Local Cached (code change)** | 0:17 (17s) | 10.8x faster |
| **Railway Auto-Build** | 0:29 (29s) | 6.3x faster |
| **GitHub Actions** | TBD | - |
| **Depot CI** | TBD | - |

## Re-running This Test

```bash
cd sample-app
```

Cached build (no changes):
```bash
docker build -t openclaw-demo:test .
```

Clean build (no cache):
```bash
docker build --no-cache -t openclaw-demo:test .
```

## Next Steps

1. [x] Push changes to trigger Railway build
2. [x] Run Flow 2 (Railway auto-build) and record time → **29s**
3. [ ] Run Flow 3 (GitHub Actions) and record time
4. [ ] Run Flow 4 (Depot CI) and record time
5. [ ] Update this document with all flow results

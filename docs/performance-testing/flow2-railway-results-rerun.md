## Detailed Analysis

### Test Case 1: Baseline (Cold Build)

**Log:** `flow2-railway-build-logs/railway-test2/flow2-railway-rerun-test-case-1-logs.1775093099988.log`

**Time:** **34.20 seconds**

**Build Breakdown:**
- npm ci (deps): ~15s
- npm ci (production-deps): ~15s
- TypeScript build: ~1.3s
- Total: 34.20s

**Cache Behavior:**
- Cold build on new branch (no cache)
- All layers built from scratch
- Health check: Passed

**Comparison:**
| Flow | Time | vs Flow 2 |
|------|------|-----------|
| Flow 1 (Local) | 162s | 4.7x slower |
| Flow 2 (Railway) | **34.20s** | baseline |
| Flow 3 (GitHub Actions) | 141s | 4.1x slower |
| Flow 4 (Depot CI) | 31s | Depot 1.1x faster |

**Key Insight:** Railway's cold build (34.20s) is still very competitive! Only Depot CI (31s) is slightly faster.

**Note:** Previous test showed 3.66s but that was with warm cache on a reused branch. This 34.20s is the true cold build time.

## Next Steps

**Remaining tests to run:**
- Test 2: Comment Change
- Test 3: New Function
- Test 4: New Dependency
- Test 5: Major Changes

## How to Run Remaining Tests

**On flow2-retest branch:**

For each test case:
```bash
# 1. Apply test case
./scripts/apply-test-case-N.sh

# 2. Commit and push
git add sample-app/
git commit -m "Test Case N: [name]"
git push

# 3. Watch Railway dashboard for "Build time: XX seconds"
# 4. Record the time
```

**Reset between tests:**
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD^
git clean -fd sample-app/
```

### Test Case 2: Comment Change

**Log:** `flow2-railway-build-logs/railway-test2/flow2-railway-rerun-Applying-Test-Case-2-Comment-Change-logs.1775093870911.log`

**Time:** **23.60 seconds**

**Build Breakdown:**
- All dependency layers: CACHED ✅
- Source copy: Rebuilt (~1s)
- TypeScript build: ~4s
- Total: 23.60s

**Cache Behavior:**
- Excellent cache hit! Only source layers rebuilt
- Both `npm ci` layers cached from previous build
- Only `COPY . .` and `npm run build` executed

**Comparison:**
| Flow | Time | vs Flow 2 |
|------|------|-----------|
| Flow 1 (Local) | 14s | Local 1.7x faster |
| Flow 2 (Railway) | **23.60s** | baseline |
| Flow 3 (GitHub Actions) | 65s | GitHub 2.8x slower |
| Flow 4 (Depot CI) | 23s | Similar |

**Key Insight:** Railway's layer caching works excellently! 31% faster than cold build (34.20s → 23.60s). Only Local with persistent cache beats it for tiny changes.

## Detailed Analysis

### Test Case 1: Baseline (No Changes)

**1a. Clean Build (no cache):**
- Purpose: Measure cold build time
- Time: **2:42 (162 seconds)**
- All layers built from scratch
- npm ci: ~108s (both deps stages)
- TypeScript: ~3s
- Export: ~9s

**1b. Cached Build (no changes):**
- Purpose: Measure fully cached performance
- Time: **0:02 (2 seconds)**
- **81x faster than clean build**
- All layers cached
- Only image export overhead

---

### Test Case 2: Comment Change

**Changes:** Added timestamp comment to `src/index.ts`

**Time:** **0:14 (14 seconds)**

**Cache Behavior:**
- ✅ deps stages: CACHED
- ✅ production-deps: CACHED
- ❌ build (COPY source): REBUILT
- ❌ build (tsc): REBUILT
- ✅ production: CACHED

**Speedup:** 11.6x faster than clean build

---

### Test Case 3: New Function

**Changes:** Added `src/utils.ts` with new functions

**Time:** **0:17 (17 seconds)**

**Cache Behavior:**
- ✅ deps stages: CACHED
- ✅ production-deps: CACHED
- ❌ build (COPY source): REBUILT (new file)
- ❌ build (tsc): REBUILT
- ✅ production: CACHED

**Speedup:** 9.5x faster than clean build

---

### Test Case 4: New Dependency

**Changes:** Added ESLint to devDependencies

**Time:** **2:23 (143 seconds)**

**Cache Behavior:**
- ❌ deps: FULL REBUILD (package.json changed)
- ❌ production-deps: FULL REBUILD
- ✅ build (COPY source): CACHED
- ❌ build (tsc): REBUILT
- ❌ production: REBUILT

**Observation:** Adding a dependency invalidates all dependency layers, causing near-full rebuild. This is **slower than clean build** because clean build had some parallel processing that this sequential rebuild didn't benefit from.

---

### Test Case 5: Major Changes

**Changes:** Added lodash, moment, uuid packages

**Time:** **3:26 (206 seconds)**

**Cache Behavior:**
- ❌ deps: FULL REBUILD (many new packages)
- ❌ production-deps: FULL REBUILD
- ❌ build (COPY source): REBUILT
- ❌ build (tsc): REBUILT
- ❌ production: REBUILT

**Observation:** Significant package additions cause near-total rebuild. The npm install step took ~143 seconds alone.

---

## Key Findings

1. **Caching is critical:** Full cache is 81x faster than clean build (2s vs 162s)

2. **Source changes are fast:** Comment and function changes take 14-17 seconds (10x faster than clean)

3. **Dependency changes are expensive:** Adding one package (Test 4) causes full dependency rebuild ~143s

4. **Multiple dependencies compound:** Test 5 with 3 packages took 206s (27% slower than clean)

5. **npm ci dominates:** Dependency installation accounts for 80-90% of build time when package.json changes

## Cache Efficiency Comparison

| Test | Time | Cache Efficiency = Clean/Test × 100 |
|------|------|--------------------------------------|
| 1a. Clean | 162s | 100% (baseline) |
| 1b. Cached | 2s | ~1% (99% cache hit) |
| 2. Comment | 14s | ~9% (~91% cache hit) |
| 3. Function | 17s | ~10% (~90% cache hit) |
| 4. Dependency | 143s | ~88% (package.json change) |
| 5. Major | 206s | ~79% (many new packages) |

**Note:** "Cache Efficiency" here represents how much of the original clean build work was reused. Higher % = more work reused = better.

## Comparison with Other Flows

| Flow | Baseline (cold) | Test 2 (Comment) | Test 4 (Dependency) | Test 5 (Major) | Average |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------|----------------|---------|
| **Flow 1 (Local)** | 162s | **14s** 🏆 | 143s | 206s | 108s |
| **Flow 2 (Railway)** | 34.20s | 23.60s | 40.75s | 27.73s | 29s |
| **Flow 3 (GitHub Actions)** | 141s | 65s | 193s | 133s | 134s |
| **Flow 4 (Depot CI)** | **31s** 🏆 | 23s | **31s** 🏆 | **26s** 🏆 | **27s** 🏆 |

**Key Rankings:**
- **Baseline:** Depot (31s) > Railway (34.20s) > GitHub (141s) > Local (162s)
- **Comment:** Local (14s) > Depot (23s) ≈ Railway (23.60s) > GitHub (65s)
- **Dependency:** Depot (31s) > Railway (40.75s) > Local (143s) > GitHub (193s)
- **Major:** Depot (26s) > Railway (27.73s) > GitHub (133s) > Local (206s)
- **Overall:** Depot (27s avg) 🏆 > Railway (29s) > Local (108s) > GitHub (134s)

## Recommendations

1. **Use cached builds when possible** - 81x speedup is massive
2. **Batch dependency changes** - Group multiple package additions to avoid repeated npm ci
3. **Monitor package.json changes** - Even one new package triggers full dependency rebuild
4. **Consider Depot CI** - For projects with frequent code changes, Depot's distributed cache could significantly improve Test 2-3 times
